# Next Steps

## Current state

- Local git repository is initialized on `main`.
- Code is pushed to the private GitHub repository: `https://github.com/TheAntelope/Newsletter-pod`.
- Backend tests pass locally.
- iOS source scaffold exists under `ios/NewsletterPodApp`.
- Xcode project generation is configured with XcodeGen in `ios/project.yml`.
- Hosted macOS build and TestFlight publishing are configured in `codemagic.yaml`.
- Secrets and generated artifacts are ignored by git.

## TestFlight deployment

1. Create or confirm an Apple Developer account.
2. In App Store Connect, create a new iOS app record.
3. Use bundle ID `com.newsletterpod.app`, or update `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in `ios/project.yml` before creating the app record.
4. Enable **Sign in with Apple** for the bundle ID.
5. Create the StoreKit subscription products:
   - `com.newsletterpod.paid.monthly`
   - `com.newsletterpod.paid.annual`
6. In Codemagic, connect the GitHub repository:
   - `TheAntelope/Newsletter-pod`
7. In Codemagic, add an App Store Connect API key integration named `codemagic`.
8. In Codemagic, enable iOS App Store code signing for bundle ID `com.newsletterpod.app`.
9. Optional: set `APP_STORE_APPLE_ID` in Codemagic after the App Store Connect app record exists.
10. Run the `ios-testflight` workflow in Codemagic.

## Before the first real TestFlight build

1. Confirm the iOS app base URL points at the deployed backend in `ios/NewsletterPodApp/AppConfiguration.swift`.
2. Confirm the backend Cloud Run service is deployed and reachable.
3. Confirm Sign in with Apple backend settings are configured:
   - `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SESSION_SIGNING_SECRET`
4. Confirm App Store subscription product IDs match the iOS app and backend defaults:
   - `com.newsletterpod.paid.monthly`
   - `com.newsletterpod.paid.annual`
5. Decide whether to keep the placeholder app icon for TestFlight or replace it before external testing.

## Backend follow-up

1. Complete real Apple identity token verification for `POST /v1/auth/apple`.
2. Complete App Store Server Notification signed-payload verification for `POST /v1/billing/app-store/notifications`.
3. Configure the weekly dispatcher in Cloud Scheduler to call `POST /jobs/dispatch-weekly-podcasts` every 15 minutes.
4. Configure Cloud Tasks for per-user podcast generation if dispatch should enqueue work instead of processing inline.
5. Run an end-to-end test with one real user account:
   - Sign in with Apple
   - Configure sources
   - Configure podcast format
   - Configure weekly schedule
   - Generate an episode
   - Subscribe to the private feed in Apple Podcasts
   - Confirm the episode plays
